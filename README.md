Project Title: Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning applications. The goal is to handle missing values, encode categorical features, normalize numerical features, and visualize outliers. By the end of this project, you will have a cleaned dataset ready for analysis or modeling.

Objectives
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning.
Understand the importance of data preprocessing in improving model accuracy.
Gain hands-on experience with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics and whether they survived the disaster.

Tools Used
Python: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Steps Taken
Import the Dataset: Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
Explore Basic Information: Checked for null values and data types.
Handle Missing Values: Filled missing values using median and mode.
Convert Categorical Features: Used one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
Normalize/Standardize Numerical Features: Scaled numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Visualize Outliers: Used boxplots to identify and remove outliers from the dataset.
Save the Cleaned Data: Exported the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for further analysis.
